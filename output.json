        "explanation": "The reference answer states that the rank r must be less than or equal to the number of rows m (r \u2264 m). The student's answer expands on this by correctly stating that the rank r must also be greater than or equal to 0 (0 \u2264 r). Therefore, the student's answer is more comprehensive as it includes both bounds for r, while the reference answer only provides one side of the inequality. However, the core inequality (r \u2264 m) is still present in the student's answer. Overall, the student's answer is correct and helpful, providing a complete understanding of the relationship between rank and the number of rows.",

The student's answer correctly identifies that d must lie in the column space of A\u1d57, which is indeed equivalent to the row space of A. Therefore, while the phrasing could be clearer, the student's answer is fundamentally correct in terms of the mathematical relationship.

The student's answer correctly identifies that this condition is equivalent to the nullspace of A\u1d57 containing only the zero vector, which is a valid interpretation. However, the student's answer introduces the rank condition (r = m) without explicitly connecting it to the uniqueness condition stated in the reference answer.
