    "o1Answer": "The determinant of P is 1.",
    "context": "Permutation matrices have determinants ±1. Since P³ = I and P ≠ I, det(P) = 1.",
    "evaluation": "The candidate's answer 'The determinant of P is 1.' correctly identifies the determinant as 1, matching the reference answer '1.'",

    "question": "How many pivots are required for a 4×4 matrix A to satisfy A = LU with four pivots?",
    "referenceAnswer": "4",
    "o1Answer": "Four pivots are required for A to satisfy A = LU with full rank.",
    "context": "The pivots are the nonzero entries on the diagonal of U. So there are four pivots when these four conditions are satisfied: a ≠ 0, b ≠ a, c ≠ b, and d ≠ c.",
    "evaluation": "The candidate's answer 'Four pivots are required for A to satisfy A = LU with full rank.' correctly identifies that four pivots are needed for a full rank 4×4 matrix to satisfy the LU decomposition, aligning with the reference answer '4.'",

    "question": "What are the independent variables when solving Ax = 0 for A = [[1, 5, 7, 9], [0, 4, 1, 7], [2, -2, 11, -3]]?",
    "referenceAnswer": "x3 and x4",
    "o1Answer": "The independent variables are x3 and x4.",
    "context": "Since the matrix has 2 pivots, the variables x3 and x4 are free and can be chosen independently.",
    "evaluation": "The candidate's answer 'The independent variables are x3 and x4.' accurately reflects the reference answer 'x3 and x4.' It is correct and fully answers the question.",

    "question": "How is the nullspace of a product C = AB related to the nullspaces of A and B?",
    "referenceAnswer": "N(C) = N(A) ∩ N(B)",
    "o1Answer": "The nullspace of C is the intersection of the nullspaces of A and B; that is, N(C) = N(A) ∩ N(B).",
    "context": "N(C) = N(A) ∩ N(B) contains all vectors that are in both nullspaces: Ax = 0 and Bx = 0.",
    "evaluation": "The candidate's answer 'The nullspace of C is the intersection of the nullspaces of A and B; that is, N(C) = N(A) ∩ N(B).' accurately reflects the reference answer 'N(C) = N(A) ∩ N(B)' and correctly describes the relationship.",
