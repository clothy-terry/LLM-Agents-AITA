        "explanation": "The reference answer states that the rank r must be less than or equal to the number of rows m (r \u2264 m). The student's answer expands on this by correctly stating that the rank r must also be greater than or equal to 0 (0 \u2264 r). Therefore, the student's answer is more comprehensive as it includes both bounds for r, while the reference answer only provides one side of the inequality. However, the core inequality (r \u2264 m) is still present in the student's answer. Overall, the student's answer is correct and helpful, providing a complete understanding of the relationship between rank and the number of rows.",

The student's answer expands this to '0 \u2264 r \u2264 n', which is also correct because it includes the non-negativity of rank.

The student's answer correctly identifies that this condition is equivalent to the nullspace of A\u1d57 containing only the zero vector, which is a valid interpretation. However, the student's answer introduces the rank condition (r = m) without explicitly connecting it to the uniqueness condition stated in the reference answer. While the student's answer is correct, it could be clearer in linking the concepts of nullspace and uniqueness. Overall, the answer is mostly correct but lacks clarity in connecting the concepts.",
